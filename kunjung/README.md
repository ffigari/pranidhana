in html / css is possible to like create "layers". When clicking on an image I want to open some side content. But when that window opens the rest of the website should be blurred out and disabled. I use vimium in the browser. With this plugin when you press F, a small tags appears next to each link, and by typing that tag is like you made a click in the link. The thing that I'm noticing is that when you open a modal and I press F, tags do not appear for the link that is "behind" the modal. This means that some kind of logical separtion is made between the original content and the content of the modal (only tags for the modal appear). If I click outside the modal, this one closes and in the original content now tags start appear again when I press F. How is this achieved?
