# Praṇidhāna – n.

A vow held deep within, a steadfast intention to awaken fully—not for oneself
alone, but to ease the suffering of all beings.

This monorepo contains multiple apps. Each one is contained inside one of the
directories found in the top level, except for `/lib` dir. That one contains
code shared by all apps (eg, function to set up http server).

TODO: Add dockerfiles per app

TODO: Add docker compose

TODO: Set up basic test for docker compose which performs ping to all apps
